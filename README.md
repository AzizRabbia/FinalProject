# FinalProject
I have created a replica(small version) of 3d hyper casual game "GIANT RUSH 3D".I have created two levels.In this game, player controller take inputs using left and 
right keys to move.Player has to keep itself away from hurdles to reach the destination phase.During the gameplay,different color juniors are statically spawning.
As player  collides with same color juniors ,it will maintain player's health and scale up the player otherwise diff color body juniors will reduce player's 
health and size.Player has to collect gems as a bonus and pass through hurdles.Player will die when collide with hurdles and when its health reaches zero.Health
and gem bar is being displayed in UI.Water block also reduces player's health and size.Sounds will produce when player size increase,decrease,die,collect gems
and win the level.
